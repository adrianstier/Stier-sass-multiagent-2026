## Allstate Agency Structure

### Tier 1: Agency Leadership

**Office Manager**

### Tier 2: Licensed Sales Professionals (LSPs)

**Unlicensed CSR (Admin)**

- Focuses on scheduling, filing, handoffs
- Needs: Task handoff, archive access
- Pain points: Limited visibility, knowing when to escalate

### Tier 4: Specialists

**Financial Specialist (Life & Retirement)**
- 10+ years experience, reluctant tech adopter
- Prefers paper and phone
- Needs: Minimal viable workflow, print/export
- Pain points: "Another system to learn"

## Behavioral Archetypes

### Power User

## Insurance-Specific Workflows

- **Claim**: Claim filing and status tracking
- **Service**: Policy changes, endorsements, billing
- **Follow-up**: Callbacks, email responses
- **Prospecting**: New business development, referrals

### Critical Patterns
- Waiting for response tracking (48-hour follow-up)
- Customer callback management
- Premium amount tracking
- Renewal status (pending → contacted → confirmed → at-risk)

## UX Evaluation Framework

### Efficiency Metrics
1. **Time to First Value**: How quickly can a new user create their first task?
2. **Task Creation Speed**: Can a CSR create a task during a call (under 3 seconds)?
3. **Dashboard Comprehension**: Can an owner grasp status in under 10 seconds?
4. **Navigation Efficiency**: Clicks/taps to complete common actions

### Usability Heuristics
1. **Visibility of System Status**: Are users always informed?
2. **Match with Real World**: Does terminology match insurance jargon?
3. **User Control**: Can users easily undo/redo?
4. **Consistency**: Are patterns consistent throughout?
5. **Error Prevention**: Are mistakes hard to make?
6. **Recognition over Recall**: Is information visible when needed?
7. **Flexibility**: Power users vs. beginners supported?
8. **Aesthetic/Minimal Design**: Is it visually clean?
9. **Error Recovery**: Are errors clear and helpful?
10. **Help/Documentation**: Is guidance available when stuck?

### Accessibility Considerations
- Touch target sizes for mobile
- Color contrast for readability
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Reduced motion support

## Testing Methodology

### Persona-Based Testing
For each persona, evaluate:
1. **Onboarding**: First-time user experience
2. **Daily Workflow**: Typical task patterns
3. **Edge Cases**: Error handling, unusual scenarios
4. **Permission Boundaries**: What they can/cannot do
5. **Device Experience**: Primary device optimization

### Scenario-Based Testing
1. **High Volume**: CSR handling 25+ tasks/day
2. **Mobile Field Work**: LSP between client meetings
3. **Team Coordination**: Manager assigning and tracking
4. **Strategic Review**: Owner checking dashboard
5. **Handoff**: Task passing between roles

### Comparative Testing
- Compare experience across roles
- Identify permission boundary issues
- Test multi-device consistency
- Evaluate real-time sync reliability
