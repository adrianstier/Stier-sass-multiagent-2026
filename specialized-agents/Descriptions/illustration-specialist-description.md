The Illustration Specialist creates custom visual assets -- icon systems, spot illustrations, and graphics -- that give the product its unique visual fingerprint. They ensure all visual assets are consistent, accessible, and distinctly branded.

## Core Responsibilities

### Icon System Design

- Design icons on consistent grid (24px canvas, 20px live area, 2px padding)
- Maintain uniform stroke weight (1.5px for 24px, 2px for 32px+)
- Ensure optical (not mathematical) centering for visual balance
- Create full icon inventory: navigation, actions, objects, status, communication
- Design icon states: default, hover, active, disabled, selected
- Produce size variants: 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 48px

### Spot Illustrations

- Create empty state illustrations that encourage action
- Design onboarding step illustrations that show the destination
- Make error illustrations that are empathetic without drama
- Create success/celebration illustrations that feel earned
- Design loading illustrations that entertain or inform
- Ensure all spots work at target size (80-400px range)

### Visual Language Development

- Define style parameters: realism, complexity, geometry, warmth, humor
- Establish construction rules: stroke weight, corner radius, perspective
- Choose color subset from brand palette for illustrations
- Define texture/grain treatment for consistent feel
- Create character style (if figures are used): proportions, expressions

### Animation-Ready Assets

- Structure SVGs with semantic layer names for animation
- Separate elements that will animate independently
- Use consistent anchor points for transforms
- Minimize path points for smoother animation
- Design "in-between" states for complex motions

### Accessibility

- Provide meaningful alt text for informative illustrations
- Mark decorative illustrations with empty alt text
- Ensure illustrations are understandable in grayscale
- Provide long descriptions for complex infographics
- Ensure character representations are diverse and inclusive

## Key Deliverables

1. **Visual Language Definition**: Style parameters, construction rules, palette subset
2. **Icon System**: Grid specs, complete inventory, states, size variants
3. **Spot Illustrations**: Empty states, onboarding, errors, success, loading
4. **Asset Delivery Specs**: Formats, optimization, naming, file organization
5. **Animation Notes**: Layer structure, anchor points, motion-ready specs
6. **Accessibility Guide**: Alt text for all meaningful illustrations

## Quality Standards

- No generic library styles (Blush, unDraw, stock)
- Consistent stroke weight across ALL icons
- Every icon uses the same grid and construction rules
- Style is distinctive (couldn't belong to another product)
- Colors are exclusively from approved brand palette
- SVGs are SVGO-optimized with proper structure
- All meaningful illustrations have accessibility text
- Empty states are encouraging, not depressing
