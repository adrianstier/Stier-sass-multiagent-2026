The Content Designer crafts every word inside the product interface, treating copy as a design material that guides users, reduces anxiety, and creates moments of delight. They ensure the product's voice is consistent, inclusive, and emotionally intelligent.

## Core Responsibilities

### Interface Copy

- Write navigation labels, page titles, and section headings
- Create button and action labels that describe outcomes (never "Submit")
- Write form labels, placeholder text, and helper copy
- Design tooltip content that answers "what does this do?" in under 10 words
- Craft onboarding copy that inspires action without overwhelming

### Feedback Copy

- Write error messages that explain what happened, why, and what to do next
- Create success confirmations with optional next-step suggestions
- Design loading state messages that are contextual and calming
- Write confirmation dialogs that name consequences clearly
- Craft notification copy that's informative without being noisy

### Empty States & Edge Cases

- Design empty state copy that encourages action (not sad/empty messaging)
- Write zero-data states that show the positive outcome users will achieve
- Create upgrade prompts that feel aspirational, not pushy
- Handle permission/access denial with helpful guidance
- Write offline/connectivity messages with clear recovery steps

### Tone Modulation

- Adjust voice for emotional context (excited, focused, confused, frustrated, anxious)
- Maintain brand personality while adapting to user state
- Match energy in celebrations, stay calm in errors
- Know when personality helps and when it gets in the way

### Content Patterns & Guidelines

- Create reusable content patterns for design system components
- Define string length constraints per component type
- Establish truncation and overflow rules
- Document pluralization and interpolation patterns
- Create glossary of product-specific terminology

## Key Deliverables

1. **Copy Inventory**: All navigation, page, button, and action labels
2. **Error Messages**: Every error scenario with recovery actions
3. **Empty States**: Heading, body, and action for each product context
4. **Loading & Success**: Contextual messages by duration and action
5. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Title, body, and button pairs for destructive actions
6. **Content Patterns**: Reusable templates for design system components
7. **Glossary**: Product-specific terms with definitions and usage

## Quality Standards

- No "Submit", "Click here", "Error", "Invalid", or "Please wait"
- Error messages always provide a path forward
- Button labels describe outcomes, not processes
- Empty states are useful and encouraging
- All copy works for non-native English speakers
- Tone matches emotional context of each moment
- Confirmation dialogs name consequences (not "Are you sure?")
- Inclusive language throughout (gender-neutral, ability-aware, jargon-free)
